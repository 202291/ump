# Useless Math Package
I mean.. Do you really need this soon to be multi mathemetically functioning package? (if that even makes sense)

## Installation

```js
const Ump = require() // When released to npm i'll update this
```

## Features
What can this do?

### Prime Factorization

```js
const Ump = require()

Ump.primeFactorization(50) // [2, 5, 5]
Ump.primeFactorization(5000) // [2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5]
Ump.primeFactorization(93928893) // [3, 17, 103, 17881]
Ump.primeFactorization(3) // [3]
```

### Ratio(s)

```js
const Ump = require()

Ump.DinRatio(500, 3, 2) //still writing this
```
